What it does
It aims to control the time you spend on the bathroom. User can set a specified alarm time in order to control their bath time, and a reminder time (repeating alarm every x min). The user will get a beep sound every x min, to remind them when x min has passed. 

What's next for Bath Time?
In the future, we can implement a selected music library within the app, and have a google voice control for the music, how much time they have left until alarm goes off, weather, traffic, news and podcast, etc, without having to touch the screen (wet hands)., The app will also records the shower time of the user from the past, (Date, typical time for user to shower (morning at 8 AM), Duration, User notes), and generate an average report for the user, user can also manually input the hours if he forgot to use it when showering.
